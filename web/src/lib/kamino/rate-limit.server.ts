/**
 * Abuse throttling (server-only).
 *
 * Two layers, both counted per signed-in person:
 *   1. A general budget on every call (`overallBudget`), so a runaway script or a stuck retry
 *      loop cannot hammer the database.
 *   2. A tighter limit on actions that can be used to spam other people (`spamGuard`):
 *      posting, commenting, messaging, reporting, creating communities and so on.
 *
 * It is a sliding window kept in this server's memory. That is exactly right for one server
 * (what the Render blueprint runs). If you ever run several copies of the server, each keeps its
 * own count, which only makes the limits a little more generous.
 *
 * Set KAMINO_RATE_LIMIT=off to switch it off (the automatic tests do this for their bulk set-up).
