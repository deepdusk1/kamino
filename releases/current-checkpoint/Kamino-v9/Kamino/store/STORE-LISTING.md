# Kamino: App Store and Google Play listing (copy and paste)

> Release 9 note: this store kit predates the new contact matching, provider sign-in, analytics and billing sandbox. Treat the copy, privacy answers and screenshots below as drafts. Review the actual configured services and native permissions, update the declarations and replace device screenshots before submission. Mobile purchases and creator payouts remain unavailable. Do not advertise a feature as live solely because its configuration screen exists.

Everything below is ready to paste into App Store Connect and the Google Play Console.
Replace `https://YOUR-SERVER` with the public address of your Kamino server (see `DEPLOY.md`).

Screenshots (high-quality JPEG, which both stores accept) and the Google Play banner are in this folder:

- `ios-6.9in-1290x2796/` – upload to App Store Connect ("iPhone 6.9-inch display").
- `android-phone-1080x1920/` – upload to Google Play ("Phone screenshots").
- `google-play-feature-graphic-1024x500.png` – Google Play "Feature graphic".
- App icon: `mobile/assets/icon.png` (1024 x 1024). Both stores ask for it.

The pictures are the real app screens filled with made-up sample people, pictures and a made-up story, so nothing in them belongs to anyone real. The live-call picture shows the real call screen with a pretend call in progress (calls only run on an installed phone app). Retake it on a real phone once you have a test build if you prefer. The full sets, including the 6.5-inch iPhone size and the 13-inch iPad size, are in the `Kamino-store-pictures` folder next to this project.

## 2. Age rating questionnaires (answer honestly; these are the truthful answers for Kamino as built)

**Apple age rating**
- Unrestricted web access: No.
- User-generated content: **Yes** (posts, comments, chat).
- Violence, sexual content, profanity, horror, drugs, gambling, contests: None *by the app itself*. (Community content is moderated by reports and community leaders.)
- Result you should expect: 12+ or 17+ depending on Apple's current questions about user-generated content. Choose what Apple's form calculates. Do not pick a lower rating by hand.

**Google Play content rating (IARC)**
- Category: **Social / Communication**.
- Users can interact or exchange content: **Yes**.
- Users can share their location: No.
- Digital purchases: No.
- Contains ads: **No**.

**Minimum age:** 13 (stated in the Terms and enforced at sign-up).

## 3. Privacy questionnaires

The old v8 answers have been superseded. Release 9 includes first-party usage analytics. Complete the store forms against the deployed configuration and connected providers; this source inventory is not a completed privacy questionnaire.

- Account/contact data: user IDs, email, display name, profile preferences and optional configured phone sign-in.
- User content: posts, comments, messages, uploaded photos/video/audio/files, stories and profile content.
- App activity: post views, community visits, search history/feedback and distinct authenticated UTC member activity used for growth and retention.
- Optional contacts: the phone requests permission only after a tap. Names remain on the device; confirmed email addresses are processed transiently for matching. This flow must appear in the permission and privacy review.
- Delivery/authentication providers: configured email/SMS/OAuth, CAPTCHA, Expo push and optional safety/chat services process the data required by their actual integrations.
- Billing: native purchases are unavailable and the web sandbox is disabled by default. Configured Stripe test checkout stores a local order/access ledger; real-money billing and payouts are unfinished.
- Data export/deletion: available in Settings and on the web. The release notes describe retained pseudonymous accountability records and external test-subscription cancellation limits.
- Verify HTTPS on the deployed hostname, provider logging/retention, optional versus required data, purposes, deletion behavior and all current store definitions before submitting. No independent security review was performed in this session.

The source does not include a third-party analytics/tracking SDK. That statement does not replace reviewing services added or enabled by the operator. Use the current [Apple app privacy guidance](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/) and [Google Play Data safety guidance](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10787469).

## 4. Rules for apps with user-generated content (Apple 1.2, Google UGC policy)

Both stores reject social apps that lack the items below. Kamino has every one; paste this into the review notes so the reviewer finds them quickly.

1. Terms that forbid objectionable content: sign-up screen and Settings link to the Terms.
2. Filtering: automatic phrase filter for scams and harmful text.
3. Reporting: Report button on posts, comments, chat messages and profiles.
4. Blocking: profile → ••• → Block. Blocked people's content disappears.
5. Fast response: moderators get reports in Mod tools; leaders can remove content, mute (timed) or ban.
6. Published contact: Settings → Contact support.
7. Account deletion inside the app: Settings → Delete account.

## 5. Notes for the app reviewer (App Store Connect "App Review Information" / Play "App access")

Create a demo account on your live server first (any email and a password, plus join or create one community with a few posts), then paste:

```
Demo account
  Email:    reviewer@YOUR-DOMAIN
  Password: (the password you chose)

Kamino is a community app (similar to forums and group chats). No purchases, ads or in-app currency exist.

User-generated content safeguards (Guideline 1.2):
  • Report: tap ••• on a post or profile, or the Report link under a comment or message.
  • Block: open a profile → ••• → Block.
  • Terms/Privacy: sign-up screen and Settings.
  • Delete account: Settings → Delete account (permanent, inside the app).
  • Contact: Settings → Contact support.

Sign-in is by email and password (no third-party login).
Camera, photo library and microphone are used only when the user chooses to attach a picture, video or voice note, or joins a live call (the microphone is used only while they are in a call, the camera only if they turn video on).
Push notifications are optional and off until the user allows them.
```

## 6. Before you press "Submit for review" (checklist)

- [ ] Server is live on https and the app build points at it (`EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` in `mobile/eas.json`).
- [ ] `mobile/eas.json` and `mobile/.env` have your real support email.
- [ ] You read and adjusted `/privacy` and `/terms` (they are sensible drafts, **not legal advice**).
- [ ] Reviewer demo account exists and can sign in.
- [ ] Screenshots uploaded; icon uploaded.
- [ ] You tested the real build on a phone once (sign up, post, chat, photo, push notification).
